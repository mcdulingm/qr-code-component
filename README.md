## My process

I start with establishing the parameters of the projects like colors and sizes and then I move to setting my sections in HTML. I end off with connecting style with structure. I also focused on working from the mobile view to desktop

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not much, it's more trying to rememeber a few things since it's been a while working with SCSS.

### Continued development

I need to spend more time studying the ins and outs of SCSS.
